# BETWEEN STATEMENT
â€¢ WE use the BETWEEN operator to match a value against a range of values. For example;


    Value BETWEEN low AND high




- If the value is greater than or equal to the low value and less than or
equal to the high value, the expression returns true, or vice versa.


- We can rewrite the BETWEEN operator by using the greater than or
equal

(>=) or less than or equal ( <=) operators as the following statement:

```
value >= low AND value <= high
```
BOTH OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE THE SAME
```
 
value BETWEEN low AND high
```
