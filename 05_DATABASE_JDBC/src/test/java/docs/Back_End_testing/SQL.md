# SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.

SQL is not a database system, but it is a query language.

Suppose you want to perform the queries of SQL language on the stored data in the database. You are required to install any database management system in your systems, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc.

# What is SQL?
SQL is a short-form of the structured query language, and it is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometimes as See-Quell.

This database language is mainly designed for maintaining the data in relational database management systems. It is a special tool used by data professionals for handling structured data (data which is stored in the form of tables). It is also designed for stream processing in RDSMS.

You can easily create and manipulate the database, access and modify the table rows and columns, etc. This query language became the standard of ANSI in the year of 1986 and ISO in the year of 1987.

If you want to get a job in the field of data science, then it is the most important query language to learn. Big enterprises like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, use SQL for storing the data in the back-end.

# Why SQL?
Nowadays, SQL is widely used in data science and analytics. Following are the reasons which explain why it is widely used:

- The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update, and delete the data from the relational database.
- SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the data from the relational database management systems.
- It also helps them to describe the structured data.
- It allows SQL users to create, drop, and manipulate the database and its tables.
- It also helps in creating the view, stored procedure, and functions in the relational database.
- It allows you to define the data and modify that stored data in the relational database.
- It also allows SQL users to set the permissions or constraints on table columns, views, and stored procedures.

History of SQL
"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" was a paper which was published by the great computer scientist "E.F. Codd" in 1970.

The IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed the SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) after learning from the paper given by E.F. Codd. They both developed the SQL at the San Jose Research laboratory of IBM Corporation in 1970.

At the end of the 1970s, relational software Inc. developed their own first SQL using the concepts of E.F. Codd, Raymond Boyce, and Donald Chamberlin. This SQL was totally based on RDBMS. Relational Software Inc., which is now known as Oracle Corporation, introduced the Oracle V2 in June 1979, which is the first implementation of SQL language. This Oracle V2 version operates on VAX computers.

# Process of SQL
When we are executing the command of SQL on any Relational database management system, then the system automatically finds the best routine to carry out our request, and the SQL engine determines how to interpret that particular command.

Structured Query Language contains the following four components in its process:

- Query Dispatcher
- Optimization Engines
- Classic Query Engine
- SQL Query Engine, etc.

# Some SQL Commands
The SQL commands help in creating and managing the database. The most common SQL commands which are highly used are mentioned below:

1) CREATE command
2) UPDATE command
3) DELETE command
4) SELECT command
5) DROP command
6) INSERT command


## CREATE Command

This command helps in creating the new database, new table, table view, and other objects of the database.

## UPDATE Command
This command helps in updating or changing the stored data in the database.

## DELETE Command
This command helps in removing or erasing the saved records from the database tables. It erases single or multiple tuples from the tables of the database.

## SELECT Command
This command helps in accessing the single or multiple rows from one or multiple tables of the database. We can also use this command with the WHERE clause.

## DROP Command
This command helps in deleting the entire table, table view, and other objects from the database.

## INSERT Command
This command helps in inserting the data or records into the database tables. We can easily insert the records in single as well as multiple rows of the table.

## SQL vs No-SQL
Down below are the  differences between the SQL and NoSQL, which are necessary to understand:

## SQL	
1) SQL is a relational database management system.
2) The query language used in this database system is a structured query language.
3) The schema of SQL databases is predefined, fixed, and static.
4) These databases are vertically scalable.
5) The database type of SQL is in the form of tables, i.e., in the form of rows and columns.
6) It follows the ACID model.
10. Complex queries are easily managed in the SQL database.
11. This database is not the best choice for storing hierarchical data.
12. All SQL databases require object-relational mapping.
13. Gauges, CircleCI, Hootsuite, etc., are the top enterprises that are using this query language.
14. SQLite, Ms-SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are examples of SQL database systems.

## No-SQL
1) While No-SQL is a non-relational or distributed database management system.
2) The query language used in the No-SQL database systems is a non-declarative query language.
3) The schema of No-SQL databases is a dynamic schema for unstructured data.	
4) These databases are horizontally scalable.
5) The database type of No-SQL is in the form of documents, key-value, and graphs.
6) It follows the BASE model.
7) NoSQL databases cannot handle complex queries.
8) While No-SQL database is a perfect option for storing hierarchical data.
9) Many No-SQL databases do not require object-relational mapping.
10) Airbnb, Uber, and Kickstarter are the top enterprises that are using this query language.
11) Redis, MongoDB, Hbase, BigTable, CouchDB, and Cassandra are examples of NoSQL database systems.

# Advantages of SQL
SQL provides various advantages which make it more popular in the field of data science. It is a perfect query language which allows data professionals and users to communicate with the database. Following are the best advantages or benefits of Structured Query Language:

1. No programming needed

SQL does not require a large number of coding lines for managing the database systems. We can easily access and maintain the database by using simple SQL syntactical rules. These simple rules make the SQL user-friendly.

2. High-Speed Query Processing

A large amount of data is accessed quickly and efficiently from the database by using SQL queries. Insertion, deletion, and updation operations on data are also performed in less time.

3. Standardized Language

SQL follows the long-established standards of ISO and ANSI, which offer a uniform platform across the globe to all its users.

4. Portability

The structured query language can be easily used in desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and even smartphones. It can also be used with other applications according to the user's requirements.

5. Interactive language

We can easily learn and understand the SQL language. We can also use this language for communicating with the database because it is a simple query language. This language is also used for receiving the answers to complex queries in a few seconds.

6. More than one Data View

The SQL language also helps in making the multiple views of the database structure for the different database users.

Disadvantages of SQL
With the advantages of SQL, it also has some disadvantages, which are as follows:

1. Cost

The operation cost of some SQL versions is high. That's why some programmers cannot use the Structured Query Language.

2. Interface is Complex

Another big disadvantage is that the interface of Structured query language is difficult, which makes it difficult for SQL users to use and manage it.

3. Partial Database control

The business rules are hidden. So, the data professionals and users who are using this query language cannot have full database control.


# SQL Syntax
When you want to do some operations on the data in the database, then you must have to write the query in the predefined syntax of SQL.

The syntax of the structured query language is a unique set of rules and guidelines, which is not case-sensitive. Its Syntax is defined and maintained by the ISO and ANSI standards.

Following are some most important points about the SQL syntax which are to remember:

- You can write the keywords of SQL in both uppercase and lowercase, but writing the SQL keywords in uppercase improves the readability of the SQL query.
- SQL statements or syntax are dependent on text lines. We can place a single SQL statement on one or multiple text lines.
- You can perform most of the action in a database with SQL statements.
- SQL syntax depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
# SQL Statement
SQL statements tell the database what operation you want to perform on the structured data and what information you would like to access from the database.

The statements of SQL are very simple and easy to use and understand. They are like plain English but with a particular syntax.

### Simple Example of SQL statement:
```
SELECT "column_name" FROM "table_name";    
```

Each SQL statement begins with any of the SQL keywords and ends with the semicolon (;). The semicolon is used in the SQL for separating the multiple Sql statements which are going to execute in the same call. In this SQL tutorial, we will use the semicolon (;) at the end of each SQL query or statement.

## Most Important SQL Commands and Statements

##Here are some examples with syntax:

## 1. SELECT Statement
   This SQL statement reads the data from the SQL database and shows it as the output to the database user.

Syntax of SELECT Statement:
```
SELECT column_name1, column_name2, .…, column_nameN  
[ FROM table_name ]  
[ WHERE condition ]  
[ ORDER BY order_column_name1 [ ASC | DESC ], .... ]; 
```
Example of SELECT Statement:
```
SELECT Emp_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, City  
FROM Employee_details  
WHERE Salary = 100000  
ORDER BY Last_Name  
```
This example shows the **Emp_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, and City** of those employees from the Employee_details table whose **Salary** is **100000**. The output shows all the specified details according to the ascending alphabetical order of **Last_Name**.


## 2. UPDATE Statement
   This SQL statement changes or modifies the stored data in the SQL database.

**Syntax of UPDATE Statement**:

UPDATE table_name  
SET column_name1 = new_value_1, column_name2 = new_value_2, ...., column_nameN = new_value_N  
[ WHERE  CONDITION ];  
```
**Example of UPDATE Statement:**

## 3. DELETE Statement
   This SQL statement deletes the stored data from the SQL database.

**Syntax of DELETE Statement:**
```
DELETE FROM table_name  
[ WHERE CONDITION ];  
```
**Example of DELETE Statement:**
```
DELETE FROM Employee_details  
WHERE First_Name = 'Sumit';  
```

This example deletes the record of those employees from the **Employee_details** table whose **First_Name** is **Sumit** in the table.

## 4. CREATE TABLE Statement
   This SQL statement creates the new table in the SQL database.

**Syntax of CREATE TABLE Statement:**
```
CREATE TABLE table_name  
(  
column_name1 data_type [column1 constraint(s)],  
column_name2 data_type [column2 constraint(s)],  
.....  
.....,  
column_nameN data_type [columnN constraint(s)],  
PRIMARY KEY(one or more col)  
);  
```

**Example of CREATE TABLE Statement:**
```
CREATE TABLE Employee_details(  
Emp_Id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,  
First_name VARCHAR(30),  
Last_name VARCHAR(30),  
Salary Money,  
City VARCHAR(30),  
PRIMARY KEY (Emp_Id)  
);  
```

This example creates the table **Employee_details** with five columns or fields in the SQL database. The fields in the table are **Emp_Id, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary**, and **City**. The **Emp_Id** column in the table acts as a **primary key**, which means that the Emp_Id column cannot contain duplicate values and null values.

## 5. ALTER TABLE Statement
   This SQL statement adds, deletes, and modifies the columns of the table in the SQL database.

**Syntax of ALTER TABLE Statement:**
```
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype[(size)];  
```
The above SQL alter statement adds the column with its datatype in the existing database table.
```
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name column_datatype[(size)]; 
``` 
The above 'SQL alter statement' renames the old column name to the new column name of the existing database table.
```
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name; 
``` 
The above SQL alter statement deletes the column of the existing database table.


**Example of ALTER TABLE Statement:**
```
ALTER TABLE Employee_details   
ADD Designation VARCHAR(18); 
``` 
This example adds the new field whose name is **Designation** with size **18** in the **Employee_details** table of the SQL database.

## 6. DROP TABLE Statement
   This SQL statement deletes or removes the table and the structure, views, permissions, and triggers associated with that table.

**Syntax of DROP TABLE Statement:**
```
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ]  
table_name1, table_name2, ……, table_nameN;
```  
The above syntax of the drop statement deletes specified tables completely if they exist in the database.

**Example of DROP TABLE Statement:**
```
DROP TABLE Employee_details;  
``` 
This example drops the Employee_details table if it exists in the SQL database. This removes the complete information if available in the table.

## 7. CREATE DATABASE Statement

**Syntax of DROP DATABASE Statement:**
```
DROP DATABASE database_name; 
``` 
**Example of DROP DATABASE Statement:**
```
DROP DATABASE Company;   
```
The above example deletes the company database from the system.

## 9. INSERT INTO Statement

This SQL statement inserts the data or records in the existing table of the SQL database. This statement can easily insert single and multiple records in a single query statement.

**Syntax of insert a single record:**
```
INSERT INTO table_name  
(   
column_name1,   
column_name2, .…,   
column_nameN  
)  
VALUES   
(value_1,   
value_2, ..…,   
value_N  
);  
```

**Example of insert a single record:**
```
INSERT INTO Employee_details  
(   
Emp_ID,   
First_name,  
Last_name,  
Salary,  
City  
)  
VALUES   
(101,   
Akhil,  
Sharma,  
40000,  
Bangalore  
);  
```

This example inserts **101** in the first column, **Akhil** in the second column, **Sharma** in the third column, **40000** in the fourth column, and **Bangalore** in the last column of the table **Employee_details**.

**Syntax of inserting a multiple records in a single query**:
```
INSERT INTO table_name  
( column_name1, column_name2, .…, column_nameN)  
VALUES (value_1, value_2, ..…, value_N), (value_1, value_2, ..…, value_N),….;  
```

Example of inserting multiple records in a single query:
```
INSERT INTO Employee_details  
( Emp_ID, First_name, Last_name, Salary, City )  
VALUES (101, Amit, Gupta, 50000, Mumbai), (101,  John, Aggarwal, 45000, Calcutta), (101, Sidhu, Arora, 55000, Mumbai);
```  
This example inserts the records of three employees in the Employee_details table in the single query statement.

## 10. TRUNCATE TABLE Statement
    This SQL statement deletes all the stored records from the table of the SQL database.

**Syntax of TRUNCATE TABLE Statement:**
```
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

```
**Example of USE DATABASE Statement:**
```
USE Company; 
```  
This example uses the company database.

# SQL Data Types
Data types are used to represent the nature of the data that can be stored in the database table. For example, in a particular column of a table, if we want to store a string type of data then we will have to declare a string data type of this column.

Data types mainly classified into three categories for every database.

- String Data types
- Numeric Data types
- Date and time Data types
