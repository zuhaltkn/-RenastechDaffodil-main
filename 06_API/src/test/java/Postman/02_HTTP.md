# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access by the click of a mouse or a touch screen.

## MAIN IDEAS:
- The API's that we are using uses the HTTPS protocol.
- HTTPS stand for Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- HTTPS ensures that the connection is encrypted.
- All API's should use HTTPS.
- From our point of view, HTTP and HTTPS are the same.
- The HTTP request message will contain:
    - URL (address)
    - Request method (GET, POST, PUT ...)
    - Headers (User-agent: Postman)
    - Body
- The HTTP response message will contain:
    - Status code (200, 404, 500).
    - Headers
    - Body
