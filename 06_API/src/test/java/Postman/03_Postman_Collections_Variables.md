# Postman Collections and Variables

### Main Ideas:

- You can save requests so that you can re-use them later.
- All requests need to be added to a Postman collection.
- Typically you will have a Postman collection for each API.
- We are storing the bade address of the API in a collection variable called baseUrl.
- Our saved baseUrl will be displayed as {{baseUrl}} in the address bar.
- Variables allow us to avoid repeating the same information.
- Variables allow us to easily make changes.
- A Postman variable has two states.
