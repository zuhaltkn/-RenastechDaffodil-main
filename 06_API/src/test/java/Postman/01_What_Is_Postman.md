# WHAT IS POSTMAN?

- Postman is an API client
- We use Postman for:
    - Developing API's
    - Testing API's
    - Sharing API's
    - Documenting API's


# MAIN IDEAS

### There are two ways to run Postman:
- a standalone app
- directly in the browser

The standalone app is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Postman on the web works with any browser but you may need to download Postman Desktop Agent if you request fails.


### Your first request with Postman:

- To use an **API**, you need to read the **API** documentation.
- Work in Postman is organized in WorkSpaces.
- A status code 200 (or any status like 2XX) indicates that the request was successful.











Postman is a tool that allows us to easily work with API's.  Postman is used to build HTTP requests that we send to the server running the API.
