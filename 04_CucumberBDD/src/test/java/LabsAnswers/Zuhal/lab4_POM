What is Page Object Model ?

Page object model is a design pattern. We use page object model in our Selenium and Cucumber project.
In my framework I use POM to design and maintain my framework. All the  web pages related to my project
 as home page, login page and etc  needs to be saved separately under pages package. In this way all my WebElements
 related to specific web page will be stored under page.class in page package. Page.class will identify the WebElements
 of that web page and also contains Page methods which perform actions on those WebElements. To locate my WebElements and
  use them we need to connect driver with object of this class, for that we use Page Factory initial in constructor.
  Page Factory allows to use @Find By annotation  to locate our WebElements. WebElements in this class will be stored "private"
  to be able to reach them from other package we use Java OOP concept Encapsulation getter and setter methods in this classes.
With help of POM we store all the WebElements at pages.package. In this way we don't hard code. If u locate ur WebElement in different 10 testcases,
and developer changes this WebElement locator, u need to change them in 10 testcases. It is time-consuming and wrong approach in automation testing.
In this case if u use POM u will need to changes only once on pages and all related codes will be updated. POM helps make the code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
