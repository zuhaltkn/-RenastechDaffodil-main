# Configure Cucumber Setup In IntelliJ Tutorial

Selenium is a test automation framework extensively used by organizations looking to expedite the web-product testing process. As far as test automation frameworks in Java are concerned, TestNG is largely preferred by QA engineers for the development & enhancement of test suites. With the adoption of Agile methodology in the work environment, a diverse set of stakeholders like QAs, technical managers, program managers; including non-technical team members are willing to work collaboratively for the betterment of the product.

The project lifecycle includes the business analysts and other stakeholders testing the application in a thorough manner. This is where the necessity to incorporate Behaviour Driven Development(BDD) comes into the picture. Cucumber is a popular BDD tool that is widely used for test automation.

In the first article of the Cucumber Selenium tutorial series, we will see how to setup Cucumber in Eclipse and IntelliJ for automated browser testing.


#What is Cucumber framework in Selenium
Cucumber is a Behavior Driven Development(BDD) framework used for automated browser testing. It enables diverse project stakeholders to come up with test scenarios that are written in plain English. This encourages participation from team members that do not come from a technical background.


This simple text uses Gherkin language which can be easily understood by technical & non-technical people alike. Cucumber is written using the Ruby programming language but it supports other popular languages like Java, Python, and more.

# Advantages of Cucumber framework
Though there are a number of BDD tools like SpecFlow, Behave, etc.; Cucumber for Selenium automation is the most popular of them all.

Here are the major reasons why QA engineers prefer Cucumber over other BDD frameworks:

### 1) Technical and business teams can participate in test scenario development since the tests are written in plain & simple English.
### 2) It supports multiple programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc.
### 3) No prior coding experience is required to come up with test scenarios in Cucumber Selenium. Even a manual tester with zero exposure to coding can be a part of Cucumber framework creation.
### 4) It helps in the creation of modular and reusable code.
Now that we have covered the basics of the Cucumber framework, letâ€™s look at how to setup Cucumber in Eclipse. In this IntelliJ Cucumber tutorial, we would also cover setting up Cucumber for IntelliJ and using Cucumber with Maven. Here are the pre-requisites for installing the Cucumber framework:

### 1) Install Java
### 2) Install IntelliJ for Java
### 3) Install Maven
### 4) Install Selenium WebDriver
### 5) Install JUnit
### 6) Install Cucumber
Once you are done with all the installations mentioned above, you can now proceed with Cucumber setup in Eclipse and IntelliJ (i.e. IDE of your choice). We would cover IntelliJ setup with Cucumber in the IntelliJ Cucumber tutorial section of this blog.
