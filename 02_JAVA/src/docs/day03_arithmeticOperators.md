## History of Java

Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:

Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
## Data Types

## Arithmetic Operators

Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups −

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Misc Operators

The Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the arithmetic operators −

Assume integer variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −

| **Operator** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + (Addition) | Adds values on either side of the operator. | A + B will give 30 |
| - (Subtraction) | Subtracts right-hand operand from left-hand operand. | A - B will give -10 |
| \* (Multiplication) | Multiplies values on either side of the operator. | A \* B will give 200 |
| / (Division) | Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand. | B / A will give 2 |
| % (Modulus) | Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns remainder. | B % A will give 0 |
| ++ (Increment) | Increases the value of operand by 1. | B++ gives 21 |
| -- (Decrement) | Decreases the value of operand by 1. | B-- gives 19 |

The Relational Operators

There are following relational operators supported by Java language.

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −

[Show Examples](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_relational_operators_examples.htm)

| **Operator** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == (equal to) | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true. |
| != (not equal to) | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. | (A != B) is true. |
| \> (greater than) | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A \> B) is not true. |
| \< (less than) | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A \< B) is true. |
| \>= (greater than or equal to) | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A \>= B) is not true. |
| \<= (less than or equal to) | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A \<= B) is true. |
