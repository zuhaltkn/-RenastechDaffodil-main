#Java While Loop
The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true. As soon as the Boolean condition becomes false, the loop automatically stops.

The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.

##The different parts of do-while loop:

1. ###Condition:   
It is an expression which is tested. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed and control goes to update expression. When the condition becomes false, we exit the while loop.
2. ###Update expression: 
Every time the loop body is executed, the this expression increments or decrements loop variable.
4. ###Java Infinitive While Loop:
   If you pass true in the while loop, it will be infinitive while loop.
