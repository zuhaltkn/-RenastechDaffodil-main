###Java Continue Statement
The continue statement is used in loop control structure when you need to jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. It can be used with for loop or while loop.

The Java continue statement is used to continue the loop. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified condition. In case of an inner loop, it continues the inner loop only.

We can use Java continue statement in all types of loops such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop.

#Java Continue Statement with Inner Loop
It continues inner loop only if you use the continue statement inside the inner loop.

#Java Continue Statement with Labelled For Loop
We can use continue statement with a label.  So, we can continue any loop in Java now whether it is outer loop or inner.
