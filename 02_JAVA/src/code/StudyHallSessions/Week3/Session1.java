        ////Discount and Revenue
        ////Revenue can be calculated as the selling price of the product times the quantity sold, i.e.
        // revenue = price × quantity. Write a program that asks the user to enter product price and quantity and then calculate the revenue.
        // If the revenue is more than 5000 a discount is 10% offered. Program should display the discount and net revenue.

        //Variables
        double discount=0;
        double revenue =0;

        double price=50.99;
        double quantity=100;

        revenue = price * quantity;

        if (revenue > 5000){

            discount= 5000 * 0.10;  // percentage 80% ==> 0.8 ,, percentage 25, 0.25;

            revenue = revenue - discount;
            // net revenue

            System.out.println("revenue = " + revenue);
