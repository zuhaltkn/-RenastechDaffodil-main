    /*
    Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
Constructor chaining can be done in two ways:

Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in same class
From base class: by using super() keyword to call constructor from the base class.-- we will see this later

Why do we need constructor chaining ?
This process is used when we want to perform multiple tasks in a single constructor
rather than creating a code for each task in a single constructor we create a separate constructor for each task
and make their chain which makes the program more readable.

///to be able to call constructor you will need to use this() , this(10) , this("hello) etc
//you can only call one costructor from another one
//this ( ) keyword has to be first line in your constructor

// //this: refers to object instances
//        //this.: instances of the object
//        //this(): used for calling constructors within current class


//
//    constructor calls:(chainning) by using this() keyword
//            1. only constructor can call other constructor
//            2. constructor cannot be called by its name,  this() is used for calling
//            3. constructor call needs to be at the first step
//            4. One constructor can only call one constructor
//            5. Contructor cannot call itself or conatin itself
